To answer this question, we have created a solution on Tableau in the form of a story with 3 dashboards. 
These visualizations give the user the possibility to observe the general evolution of babies in France on a temporal or geographical scale. To facilitate the reading, we have created parameters:
 -time scale (decade, every 20 years, every 40 years) 

- level of popularity of the first name in time (number of times the name appears in the top 10, top 20, ... in time. We have used the RANK() function.

different filters have also been implemented (gender, period, number of names to display ...) 
the trends appear clearly. 

for question 2, the dashboard 2 focuses on the regional effect of the data. by means of the different filters mentioned above, we can see the evolution in time on the different regions of one or several first names.

for question 3, we have given the user the possibility to explore the evolution of names by gender

Also, we added the possibility to make animations and see the evolution of names through time on the sheets:
-time series name
-time series ticket number
